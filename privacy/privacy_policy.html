                    <p>The personal information we may gather about you through our Services can be categorized as
                        follows:</p>

                    <h4>1.1. Information that you provide voluntarily</h4>
                    <div class="service-info">
                        <p>Some areas of our Services may request that you voluntarily provide personal information. For
                            instance, we may ask for certain details to create an account, start playing our games,
                            subscribe to marketing communications, or submit inquiries to us, such as:</p>
                        <ul>

                            at the time we ask for it.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h4>1.2 Information we collect automatically</h4>
                    <div class="service-info">
                        <h2>Information Collection</h2>
                        <p>When you engage with our Services, we may automatically gather specific information from you
                            and/or your device that could be classified as personal information according to relevant
                            data protection regulations. This information may include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your communications within the Service (such as in-game chats and messages exchanged
                                with other players).
                            </li>
                            <li>Data and insights related to your usage of our Services (for instance, your progress in
                                games, levels completed, sessions duration, preferred settings, the advertisements you
                                have viewed in-game, and your in-game or game preferences, including connections with
                                friends and referral sources).
                            </li>
                            <li>Your IP address along with device identifiers like your Advertising ID and Device ID
                                numbers (for further details, see "Advertising IDs and Device IDs").
                            </li>
                            <li>The type of device you are using and its operating system.</li>
                            <li>General location information (such as country or city) derived from your IP address.
                            </li>
                            <li>GPS location data, provided you give your consent.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The term “Advertising ID” refers to the Apple Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) used on Apple
                            devices and the Google Advertising Identifier (GAID) for Android devices. These identifiers
                            are unique to each mobile device and are utilized by advertisers for targeted advertising
                            based on interests. They remain consistent across applications, enabling cross-app tracking.
                            On Apple devices, you can opt-out by selecting the “Limit Ad Tracking” option in your
                            privacy settings. On Google Android devices, you can opt-out by selecting “Opt out of
                            interest-based ads.” Advertising IDs are temporary, non-personal identifiers uniquely linked
                            to your device. Similar technologies include tracking pixels embedded in advertisements,
                            which help companies (including advertisers and marketers) identify your device when you
                            access various websites and applications.</p>

                        <p>“Device identifier/information” encompasses the type of device, model, manufacturer,
                            operating system, language, and other technical specifications such as screen size and
                            processor. This data can be utilized by developers to ensure compatibility with specific
                            applications.</p>

                        <p>Some of this information may be obtained through cookies and/or similar technologies (like
                            software development kits, or SDKs), as detailed in the “Cookies and Similar Tracking
                            Technology in Websites” section below.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h4>1.3 Information we obtain from third party sources</h4>
                    <div class="service-info">
                        <h2>Information Collection from Various Sources</h2>
                        <p>(a) Data from Social Media Platforms. You have the option to connect to our Services through
                            your social media accounts. The specific information we obtain will depend on your privacy
                            settings on those platforms, but it generally includes your basic public profile details,
                            such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your username</li>
                            <li>Profile picture</li>
                            <li>Age range</li>
                            <li>Gender</li>
                            <li>Friends who are also playing the same Game</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This information is typically used to synchronize your game progress across different
                            devices, enabling you to continue playing seamlessly. Additionally, we may display your
                            Facebook friends within the Game and showcase your public Facebook profile name and picture
                            in the Game leaderboards as well as your Game profile.</p>

                        <p><strong>Important Note Regarding Angry Birds Friends:</strong> In Angry Birds Friends,
                            linking your Facebook account is a fundamental feature of the game. Disconnecting from
                            Facebook will not eliminate any data stored on our servers related to Angry Birds Friends.
                            If you wish to erase all Game data associated with your Facebook account, you can request
                            the “delete personal information” option from the Terms & Privacy page while logged into
                            your Facebook account. The main reason for disconnecting from Facebook is to switch to a
                            different Facebook account that has separate game progress.</p>

                        <p>(b) Information from Third-Party Service Providers. We may obtain personal information about
                            you from external sources. For instance, we might collect your details when you download our
                            Game or when you click on an advertisement for the Game before installation (refer to the
                            "Third Parties" section below for more information).</p>

                        <p>(c) Data from Advertising Partners. Occasionally, we may receive personal information about
                            you from other external sources. For example, if you click on an advertisement that directs
                            you to one of our Services (like an ad for one of our Games featured in another publisher’s
                            game), we will be informed about the ad network and advertising campaign that led to the
                            installation (see also the "Advertising" section below for further details).</p>

                        <p>Sankv Studios promotes its games on other apps by collaborating with ad networks to display

                        <p>Ad networks use Advertising IDs for this and additional purposes (please refer to the Privacy
                            Notices of our advertising partners listed as "Third Parties"), including:</p>
                        <ul>

                                targets ads to those users.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>(c)</strong> Ensuring that players who are currently playing the game do not see
                                advertisements for the same game. Sankv Studios may send a list of active players, in the
                                form of Advertising IDs, to an ad network, which then excludes these players from seeing
                                the ads.

                                does not have information on how Facebook determines or groups similar users.

                            We implement technical and organizational safeguards to protect the personal information we collect and process. These safeguards are designed to match the level of risk associated with processing your data. Our specific security practices include encrypting your personal information both during transmission and while it is stored.

                            Your personal information may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your home country. These countries may have different data protection laws compared to your own.

                            For example, we comply with the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for international transfers of personal information within our business group and to third-party partners. These clauses require all parties to protect personal information according to European Union data protection laws. For transfers to third-party providers certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield, similar safeguards are applied.
